1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?

```js
In ReactJS, "state" refers to an object that represents the current state of a component, which can be updated over time in response to user actions, network requests, or other events. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component and its child components to reflect the new state. State is typically managed using the useState hook, which allows developers to define and update state variables within functional components.
```

2. When would you want to use props instead of state?

```js
We use props instead of state when we want to pass one value to the child component.
```

3. When would you want to use state instead of props?

```js
We use state when we need to reaload something in our page like take one data from the user and show in the page, you could take the data using useState()
```

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?

```js
"Immutable" means unchangeable. In ReactJS, props are immutable and state is mutable.
```
